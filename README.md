### About me

My name is Georgios, I am a graduate in Cultural Anthropology (MA) and Applied Informatics (MSc), and I have embarked on a journey to expand my horizons on programming and software development. A journey that took me, abstraction to abstraction, from the foundations of computer organization to the echelons of high-level programming languages: Java, Javascript, and Python. I have learned a lot, but I am aware that I have only scratched the surface. More is to come and the journey continues!
